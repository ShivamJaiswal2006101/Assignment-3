<h1> Good Days of Anil Ambani </h1>
                    <p> During the split of businesses, Anil Ambani acquired all the new companies, and among them was Reliance Communication, which seemed like the most 
	                promisin one at the moment.  <br> In 2007, Anil Ambaniâ€™s overall wealth reached around Rs. 4 lakh crores alongside being honored with many business awards.
	                 And the driver of this wealth and fame, was Reliance Communications.  <br> Apart from this, in 2008, he made history by getting a complete subscription of
	                 the Reliance Power IPO in less than 60 seconds. At that time, it was the largest IPO that the Indian market witnessed.  <br>  Anil Ambani was on the rise, 
	                 which was evident through his development projects such as Mumbai's first metro line under Reliance Infrastructure. Investments were being made in the 
	                 entertainment industry which included investments in Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Pictures' productions. <br> He was living the life of luxury and riches, 
	                surrounded with the elites of the country coming to his place for lavish parties and movie screenings. </p>
