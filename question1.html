<h1>Anil Ambani: The Story of Riches to Rags</h1>
<div>
<p class="ab">Once among the world's richest men, Anil Ambani is in the midst of a crumbling situation today. Surrounded by billions of debt,there came such a bad time for this
   once-billionaire that in 2019, his entire business's equity value crashed to $523 million.  <br> In 2008, Anil Ambani, according to Forbes, became the 6th richest person
   in the world with a wealth of $42 billion after inheriting his wealth and being appointed as the chairman of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (Reliance ADAG).
   A portion of the influential organizations that constituted the Reliance ADA Group included Reliance Communications, Reliance Capital, Reliance Power, Reliance Infrastructure,
   Reliance Naval, Reliance Home Finance.  <br> The billion dollar business empire of the Ambani family, began with Dhirubhai Ambani, the father of Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani. 
   Coming from humble beginnings, Dhirubhai started off as a gas station attendant in Yemen and became the ideal example of the Rags to Riches story.  <br> However, as the current 
   situation has been portraying, the exact opposite seemed to have happened with his younger son, Anil Ambani. </p>
